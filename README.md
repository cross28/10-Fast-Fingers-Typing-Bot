# 10-Fast-Fingers-Typing-Bot
Typing bot for 10fastfingers.com. 


Would not recommend using on a regular account if you are an active user. There is an anti-cheat system they have inplace.


Selenium is not required to be installed. I used it for the purpose of testing the bot. You can use the webbrowser library instead. 


To properly use, when the webbrowser open, click on the box where you would type or else where ever
typing is active is gonna be spammed with a single word.
